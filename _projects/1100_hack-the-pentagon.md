## The Challenge

Because our adversaries are more creative than ever when they carry out malicious attacks, it's never been more important to find innovative ways to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen security. The Department of Defense (DoD) spends billions of dollars every year on information security, but had never attempted to address security vulnerabilities using bug bounties, a crowd-sourced model used in the private sector to secure both public-facing and internal assets.

## The Solution

The Defense Digital Service launched Hack the Pentagon in 2016, the federal government's first bug bounty program. The Hack the Pentagon program has engaged hundreds of ethical hackers around the globe to lawfully discover and disclose vulnerabilities on DoD assets. The DoD's first Vulnerability Disclosure Policy established a 24/7 pathway for security experts to safely disclose vulnerabilities on public-facing DoD websites and applications. DDS has ongoing contracts with security firms HackerOne, Synack, and Bugcrowd to facilitate assessments for DoD components and military services against their respective assets.
