## The Challenge

An estimated 75,000 of our nation’s Veterans were less than honorably discharged as a result of issues including their sexual orientation, undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or being victims of sexual assault. A less than honorable discharge not only keeps a Veteran from receiving care and benefits, but for many it also prevents reenlistment, eligibility for a competitive job, or reintegration to civilian life. Often, it also means that society doesn't recognize them as a Veteran. The military indicated that Veterans discharged under these circumstances were likely to receive an upgraded status if they submitted a strong application, but the application process was complex. It was difficult for users to know which form to submit, what evidence to provide, and what military board to submit to.

## The Solution

Digital Service at Veterans Affairs led a coalition of concerned employees across Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense to build a tool that guides users through 9 questions and provides individualized results based on their responses. The customized plain language offers clear, step-by-step guidance on how a Veteran could present a strong application to upgrade their discharge status.

Nothing would make me prouder than getting my other than honorable discharge changed...I simply want the ability of saying, yes, I served proudly, and being able to state in an application that I served.
