# Website Introduction
16 Dec 2022
Attendees: Jasmine, Imani, Alison, Cori, Allyce, Ben, Kate

* Pulled up documents Alison posted in channel, #incoming post
* Added Jasmine and Cori to #website-refresh-fall22
* We could use google analytics to tell us more about how people are using it now?


## What does success mean for you?
### Alison
There are documents in the channel about this. We're looking for the team to prioritize and tell us how much they can get done.
* Minimum accessibility (a11y)
* Information architecture: should we revise it?
* D&I report should have its own area
* We lack a way to make big changes. Things more than a page
### Imani
* gh is new to us, we're used to a lot of CMSs but not this
* Security with the `/apply` form
### Cori
* Something better than gh?
* Address pain points
* Are we reaching who we want to reach? Do people with disabilities feel welcome?
### Jasmine
* Make it easier to use
### Allyce
* Does language a11y count toward a11y?
### Ben
* Crossover content that syncs
### Kate
I'm seeing two audiences for our work:
1. Internal: comms, with a focus on improving usability
2. External: recruiting, other methods of reaching users

## Content & information architecture
* Reading level
* Organization
* What does DEIA look like on the website? beyond a pdf

## Action items
* Set up kickoff in the 1st or 2nd week of January (Kate, Ben, Allyce)
* Assess feasibility of different efforts (Kate, Ben, Allyce)
* Time v features? (Kate, Ben, Allyce)
* Exit strategy? Definition of done (Kate, Ben, Allyce)
* Familiarize with the website, clone it, get it running (Kate)

* What do checkins look like for this effort? Probably done at Monday leads meeting?

## Further questions to explore as a result of this meeting
* Do we want to have the website focus on recruiting entirely? 
* Do we want to have blogging content or bring the `medium` blog in?
* How do we build a site that can handle multiple content strategies?
