**What’s your background?**

Prior to joining the USDS team at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), I provided administrative support for various offices within the General Services Administration (GSA). Nine years ago, I started out supporting the GSA American Recovery Act office, where I worked in the Limited Scopes office, then spent the bulk of my time supporting GSA's Field Office and Opportunities Center campus at St. Elizabeths, where we provided workforce development opportunities to residents in Ward 8. I then moved to the GSA maintenance office at the Nebraska Avenue Complex.

**What inspired you to join USDS?**

Community service has always been a passion of mine, and I was heavily involved in community service and outreach efforts at my previous job. I was attracted to USDS because of the focus on people-centered development. I love that USDS is intentional about selecting projects and is dedicated to helping underrepresented communities, such as Veterans and immigrants.

**What do you want to do after USDS?**

I would love to continue working on people-centered projects that benefit communities that are oftentimes overlooked.

**What will you miss most about USDS when you leave?**

I will miss the family vibe USDS has. Everyone that I’ve interacted with has been super friendly, and works to actively counteract stereotypes we often encounter around public servants.
