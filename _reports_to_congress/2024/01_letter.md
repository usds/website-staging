## Letter from the Administrator

Since our founding in 2014, we have rolled up our sleeves to debug networks, write code, use discovery sprints, conduct user research, apply human-centered design, deploy websites, digitize applications, launch mobile applications, make compliance less painful, and more to improve government through citizen-focused tech. I’ve held various roles in this organization for six of these ten transformative years and have seen firsthand our lasting impact at the 31 agencies we’ve collaborated with. 

The most important thing we are doing, and will continue to do, is bringing in and retaining top-notch tech talent into the federal government. Over the last decade, we have recruited more than 500 Digital Service Experts. Of those, 50 are taking technology and design best practices to XX federal agencies that cut hidden costs of legacy software and mitigate security vulnerabilities while enhancing federal digital services with leading technology approaches, including AI. 

We understand that the best way to empower Americas is through technology, so we approach every project from a human-centered lens and develop cost-effective solutions that make government more accessible, accountable, and efficient. By doing so, we're catalyzing broader change—both with agencies and the American people. As adopting our best practices spreads widely through government, we'll see less waste, more savings, and customers who trust us.

We are now at the largest and highest performing our agency has ever been, with 230 resilient and highly emotionally intelligent public servants making forms simpler, language more understandable, services more accessible, and websites more secure. Below is a collection of impactful stories that these talented folks have worked on, including a website with modern infrastructure that is saving $285 million in projected estimated savings over five years and a swiftly implemented optimization strategy that is improving customer service for over three million Medicaid enrollees.

There is still so much work to be done. As civic technologists in the highest office, I believe we are positioned to correct some of the mistakes of the past and build on our emerging successes. We are full of excitement for what’s to come and every day, we'll continue to do the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the greatest need.
