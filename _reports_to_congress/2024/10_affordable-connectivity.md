####  Federal Communications Commission

The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) helps households afford the broadband they need for work, school, healthcare, and more. However, since the initial outreach program had not begun, it was only reaching 10 million out of 48 million potential households. The FCC enlisted USDS to help reach more of the eligible population.

The USDS project team evaluated the existing technical foundation of the program and conducted user research and data analysis to identify common barriers to access. Based on qualitative and quantitative research and data, the USDS team recommended high-impact, low-lift changes to the program and the enrollment process. The changes included reducing the number of steps and simplifying the language in the online form to prevent families from dropping out during the application process.

Together, FCC and USDS designed and implemented a simplified application and enrollment process, increasing access to affordable, high-quality broadband to 23 million households in America, including rural homes. 

###  Impact

- 130% increase in ACP enrollment after USDS engagement (*from 10 million to 23 million households*)
