## For the people, by the people 

*The U.S. Digital Service (USDS) delivers better government services to the American people through technology and design.* 

### The people at USDS

USDS is a group of skilled technology professionals who work on short-term appointments to implement best practices from the private sector into the public service sector. They aim to improve service delivery to federal employees and millions of Americans by providing new technology perspectives and use their expertise in designing, creating, and implementing appropriate technology solutions. The talented team at USDS possesses unique capabilities, enabling agencies to accomplish their goals and objectives better.

### How USDS works with agencies

Agencies are where the real work happens, and that change happens one step at a time. To support their work and evolution, USDS partners with agencies by embedding small, interdisciplinary teams at the agency, who work hand-in-hand with staff and contractors to deliver critical programs. USDS helps agencies procure and manage their technology systems while building their technical capacity, and learning by doing the work together. USDS transfers knowledge and expertise to agency staff, helps them hire additional talent, evolve their processes, and update expectations. As the agency builds the right capabilities, USDS no longer adds unique value, and the staff are recalled to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned to another program.

Since its founding, USDS has collaborated with 31 federal agencies. It has four types of projects in its portfolio:
-    **Agency transformation**: Agencies looking to modernize or transform their technical capabilities come to USDS for a series of projects and work, including implementation, process evolution, and technical staffing expertise.
-   **Policy implementation consultation**: In its role at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), USDS offers implementation expertise to colleagues across the Executive Office of the President (EOP) who write policy with technical components.
-    **Program implementation**: Agencies regularly have to stand up new programs or capabilities, and they routinely come to USDS for assistance with doing it well.
-    **Rapid response**: In response to urgent situations, USDS deploys teams quickly across the interagency to solve critical problems. This can be in response to situations such as infant formula shortages or a national security need. 

### The long-term value and impact of USDS

USDS enables the government to consistently deliver digital services to the American public, catalyzing long-term change and resulting in secure, efficient, and mission-serving technology. Some of the short- and long-term impacts include:
