####  The United States Postal Service and the Department of Health and Human Services

In late 2021, a new and more infectious variant of COVID-19 made its way through the U.S. population. In response, the White House initiated an ambitious program that allowed every U.S. household to order free, at-home COVID-19 tests.

USDS collaborated with the United States Postal Service (USPS) and HHSâ€™ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) to make the simple, reliable, and accessible technology required to implement this program. The combined teams deployed the USDS model of human-centered design and modern technology to build a simple website that made it quick and easy for the public to order COVID-19 tests.

The launch of COVID.gov/tests was successful, as it processed up to 10 million orders per hour. The simple website interface allowed a variety of houses to use the application and the infrastructure was able to accommodate the significant order volume. 

###  Impact

Within 48 hours, 50% of residential addresses had already ordered a COVID-19 test kit from the site.

- USPS shipped over 749 million COVID-19 test kits out to the American public.
- The site's infrastructure was stable enough to receive more than 58 million COVID-19 test kit orders within the first 48 hours of its launch.
