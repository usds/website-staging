## Letter from the Administrator

I'm happy to share our latest Report to Congress. In this update, you'll see that the **United States Digital Service (USDS)** continues to produce significant value across the Federal Government, using design and technology to deliver quality services to the American public. From recovering failed systems to consolidating services and designing intuitive interfaces, we are building more secure, efficient, and modern government services with and for the American people.

**We made a measurable impact.** With the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, we changed the way Medicare pays doctors and clinicians, rewarding them for the quality—and not the quantity—of care they provide. With the Small Business Administration, we eliminated paper applications, improving the user experience and reducing the burden on small businesses. With the Department of Homeland Security, we dramatically increased efficiency by modernizing the process to become a naturalized citizen. Over a 5-year period, we project our current projects will save $617 million and redirect 1,475 labor years toward higher-value work.

**We hired top industry talent.** At USDS, our people are our greatest resource. To fulfill our mission, we must continue to attract a steady flow of great tech talent. This quarter, we're proud to report we have successfully recruited new cohorts of high-caliber talent who will continue the tradition of civic tech within government.

**Still, opportunities to modernize government services abound.** Three criteria continue to guide us when selecting new projects: what will do the greatest good for the greatest number of people in greatest need, how effective and cost-efficient our work will be, and the potential to scale technical solutions across government. In 2018, we will continue to seek out such opportunities to serve the American public.

It is an honor to build products that directly improve the lives of millions of people. I highly recommend that talented technologists looking to serve their country consider joining us. You'll never be the same again.
