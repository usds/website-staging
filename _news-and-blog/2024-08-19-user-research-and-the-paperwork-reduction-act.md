## Highlighting case studies across the government

In 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration issued an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/){:target="blank"} to improve customer experience and make service delivery simple, seamless, and secure for Americans. Since then, government agencies have been hard at work making their services, tools, and content more effective in addressing the needs of the people they serve.

User research is at the heart of transforming customer experience. The best way to ensure services are effective, efficient, easy to use, fair, and safe is to include the people it's intended for when building it. 

In this piece, we'll demonstrate: 

- The importance of user research and how it helps mitigate risk in agency projects. 

- How and when to integrate user research into a project. 

- Examples of agencies successfully incorporating and conducting certain types of user research without needing Paperwork Reduction Act approval. 

## The basics of a customer-centered approach 

Before we dive into the examples, let's discuss the basics of a customer-centered approach, and why it’s important to ensure an agency is meeting the needs of the people using its products or services. 

Creating a new digital tool or making changes to a website or service can affect the experience of millions. If working in isolation, agencies can miss important details that could slow down or prevent people from using your services. 

The key to any successful project is to **observe how real people interact with a government service or product**. Failing to prioritize user research is risky and can lead to poorly designed products and services that are difficult to access. 

## Conducting user research by the rules

The [Paperwork Reduction Act](https://pra.digital.gov/){:target="blank"} (PRA) ensures that the Federal Government collects information in a way that reduces unnecessary burden on the public. The PRA process generally involves notifying the public about each information collection and giving them a chance to provide feedback. It also includes review of a proposed information collection by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Management (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget. However, as discussed in regulation [5 CFR 1320.3(h)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320){:target="blank"}, information collection does not include items in categories that are common during user research. Agencies might not need PRA approval for most user research done on projects, depending on how the project is structured.  

Specifically, there are activities common in user research that **do not** require PRA clearance because they do not qualify as an information collection under PRA regulations (5 C.F.R. § 1320.3). Those activities include: 

- Directly observing someone using a product (i.e., observing someone filling out a form or finding information on a website) or

- Asking people non-standardized questions as part of a one-on-one research session (i.e., asking people questions orally, in an unstructured way, about navigating government benefits or signing up for an appointment). “Non-standardized,” in this context, means the questions asked vary from person to person, and are not drawn from a list of identical questions posed in every research session.

Unlike methods that constitute information collection and require PRA clearance (for example, surveys or large focus groups with a set of the same questions or tasks), these types of research conversations (direct observations or one-on-one sessions with non-standardized questions) do not require PRA approval, regardless of the number of users ultimately involved in the research. 

Direct observations and one-on-one feedback sessions can be more valuable than [focus groups](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/focus-groups-definition/){:target="blank"} or [surveys](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/should-you-run-a-survey/){:target="blank"}, since they may provide a deeper understanding of people’s behavior rather than feelings and opinions and showcase what's working well, what isn't, and why. You can learn more about talking to people with [tips](https://www.dhs.gov/cx/how-do-I-talk-to-customers){:target="blank"} from the Department of Homeland Security.



## Incorporating user research into your project
 Incorporating user research results in a better product and reduces risks. It helps address usability concerns, reduces the potential for major backlogs on call centers, increases customer satisfaction, and ensures agencies are prioritizing the right changes. Research is a continuous process, and certain project stages benefit from research, including:  

**Before a project** 

- Look at comparable systems and services to learn lessons.

- Gain a better understanding of the pain points people experience with this system or service. 

- Get to know stakeholders’ business needs or concerns, possibly using [methods](https://methods.18f.gov/){:target="blank"} suggested by 18F, the digital services agency within the General Services Administration. 

- Do desk research, such as reading threads on social media websites and discussions on online forums. Find out where people are talking about the topic, go there, and read as much as you can.

- Test high-level ideas or potential future solutions. 

**Start of a project** 

- Observe people using the existing system or service.

- Work with local groups, advocates, or nonprofits to identify people to talk to. 

- Review any comments or letters submitted by the public. 

- See what people who use the system or service are saying publicly online about their experience.

- Read research conducted on this topic.

**Middle of a project**

- Place the thing that your agency team is building in front of someone who will use it, and observe them using it.

- Create a few different product versions and solutions to each problem.
- Gather feedback on what people found easiest to use.

**In operations**

- Conduct content testing to understand what people think the message means and make updates until it’s in plain language. (For example, the agency can write improvements to system messages and try to understand what people think the messages mean until the messages are plain, understandable, and straightforward. This approach could be used for emails, text messages, policy guidance, or webpage updates.) 

- Hold one-on-one listening sessions with people to learn about existing pain points and then prioritize new features based on feedback.

Now let's take a look at seven government projects that have successfully incorporated user research and improved the customer experience without conducting an information collection requiring PRA clearance. 

By exploring these projects, you can start thinking of ways to conduct more research or advocate for more research to enhance the customer experience. This list can generate new ideas and help you find ways to integrate user research more effectively. 

## Highlighting seven government projects

### Case study 1: Conducting user research for an informative website launch

**Project** 

Reporting Unemployment Identity Theft, Department of Labor (DOL)- March 2021

**Problem** 

In 2022, thousands of Americans received a fraudulent unemployment insurance tax form (government Form 1099-G) in the mail despite never applying for unemployment insurance (UI). These individuals were victims of unemployment identity theft, and fraudsters used their information to illegally receive unemployment benefits. For most victims, understanding what steps to take next was confusing.  

**Solution** 

The DOL met with victims of UI theft and developed a [website](https://dol.gov/fraud){:target="blank"} to guide them through reporting the fraud. After the site went live, the DOL collaborated with other government agencies and organizations to incorporate the same tested language for reporting UI fraud on their sites. This created a consistent and reliable standard across all websites, fostering trustworthiness among victims. 

**User research** 

Ten unstructured, one-on-one user research sessions with victims helped the DOL learn more about the current process and what victims did when they received the fraudulent unemployment insurance form. Participants walked through their unique scenarios and researchers took detailed notes. 

During the second round of research, the main focus was observing individuals as they navigated through the newly drafted website content. Participants were instructed to vocalize their thoughts as they started at the top of the page and explained what they saw. Any aspects of the website that people found confusing were revised and improved following the sessions.

**Why did the PRA not cover this research?** 

In this project, the DOL directly observed the experiences of program applicants and participants and asked non-standardized questions on a particular process, theme, or issue without any specification of the information being sought. [See 5 CFR 1320.3(h)(3).](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320){:target="blank"}

### Case study 2: Conducting user research for a new application launch

**Project** 

A New Digital Application for VA Health Care, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) - July 2016

**Problem** 

Many Veterans found the health care application process at the VA frustrating. Most weren’t able to open the fillable PDF online application because it required a certain software that wasn’t common in most browsers. As a result, over [70 percent of visitors](https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/introducing-a-new-digital-application-for-healthcare-at-va-610d8bac4c78){:target="blank"} had trouble accessing the health care application, according to USDS research.

**Solution** 

The team developed a new, user-friendly online application that doesn't require a certain software to use. 

**User research** 

The team observed Veterans using the existing application to identify pain points and then worked on a new version. Then, they did user research sessions with the new form again to ensure it was easy and removed any previous pain points. Watch a real-life user research session, conducted by a VA employee with a Veteran at this [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPFSjtLusMc&feature=youtu.be){:target="blank"}. 

**Why did the PRA not cover this research?**

In this project, the VA directly observed the experiences of program applicants and participants and engaged in unstructured one-on-one interactions. They asked non-standardized questions on a particular process, theme, or issue without any specification of the information being sought. [See 5 CFR 1320.3(h)(3).](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320){:target="blank"}

### Case study 3: Conducting user research to inform policy and strategy

**Project** 

Welcome Corps, Department of State - February 2024

**Problem** 

The Department of State launched a new program to allow Americans to sponsor refugees. The [Welcome Corps](https://welcomecorps.org){:target="blank"} program involves forming a sponsor group, completing pre-application steps, and then submitting an application. The process was burdensome to Americans seeking to sponsor a refugee, causing frustration and incomplete applications. 

**Solution** 

The team did user research to inform which steps in the process could be improved in order to reduce unnecessary burden on sponsors and increase successful application submissions. This research helped ensure any policy changes under consideration would actually support program goals. It also helped inform the agency’s roadmap. 

**User research** 

The team met one-on-one with current sponsors to learn about their experience and met one-on-one with potential sponsors to understand what steps of the process were challenging. These research sessions used non-standardized questions. The research findings were presented to program leadership, and policy, tech, and operations teams to inform improvements to the application process. 

**Why the PRA did not cover this research?** 

In this project, the team observed the experiences of sponsors and potential sponsors and engaged in unstructured one-on-one interactions. They asked non-standardized questions on a particular process, theme, or issue without any specification of the information being sought. [See 5 CFR 1320.3(h)(3).](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320){:target="blank"}

### Case study 4: Conducting user research to streamline digital experiences

**Project**

[My VA Dashboard for Veterans, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)](https://www.usds.gov/projects/personalized-dashboard) - November 2020

**Problem** 

Many services are available to Veterans on the VA websites but it can be challenging to locate them and take action. Veterans asked for a centralized location that was relevant to their needs. 

**Solution** 

The team worked with a vendor to create My VA, a personalized dashboard for Veterans to access tools and information. 

**User research** 

A vendor conducted user research to identify the information that Veterans expect to find in the My VA Dashboard tool and the best way to navigate it. 

The contract required vendors to conduct user research to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors. The vendor conducted one-on-one, non-structured conversations with Veterans to inform how the agency should build the dashboard. 

**Why the PRA did not cover this research?** 

The contractor collected information and observed program applicants and participants by asking non-standardized questions on a particular process, theme, or issue without any specification of the information being sought. [See 5 CFR 1320.3(h)(3), (h)(6).](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320){:target="blank"}

### Case study 5: Conducting user research to inform outreach strategies via text messages

**Project** 

Child Tax Credit Outreach, Department of Treasury and the White House - June 2021

**Problem** 

When the American Rescue Plan Act became law in March 2021, millions of Americans were suddenly eligible for unprecedented tax relief by expanding both earned income and child tax credits. Americans who don’t make enough income to require a tax filing would benefit most from the expansion, but first, they needed to know about the credits and include them when they filed a tax return. 

**Solution** 

Outreach was key to reaching families in most need. The team learned throughout the year that: 

- Messages from official government entities work well, specifically, government benefits agencies. 

- Emails and text messages have worked when encouraging state and local governments to send messages directly to beneficiaries. 


 **User research** 

The team performed user research throughout the year by working with non-profits on the ground to identify research participants and understand what was working and not working. They partnered with Code for America to test several text messages to ensure clear language. They also joined research sessions to observe SNAP applicants engaging with a third-party app that helps them manage their SNAP benefits electronically. 

**Why the PRA did not cover this research?**

In this project, the groups directly observed the experiences of program applicants and participants. They asked non-standardized questions on a particular process, theme, or issue without any specification of the information being sought. [See 5 CFR 1320.3(h)(3).](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320){:target="blank"}


### Case study 6: Conducting user research with internal users of a system

**Project** 

Updates to the Unaccompanied Children Case Management System, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Administration for Children and Families, Department of Health and Human Services  – August 2022

**Problem** 

Case managers were updating both paper and digital forms when assessing a potential sponsor. Many duplications existed across the two forms, and filling out both caused inefficiencies. 

**Solution** 

The team changed the online form, eliminating the need for the paper form and transferred them to the digital experience, reducing burden for the sponsor and case manager. The updated digital form also included design improvements to enhance the flow of the questions. 

**User research** 

ORR contacted case workers nationwide and observed them filling out both versions of the form to identify pain points. Another round of research was conducted later on, once they had an updated digital form. These were one-on-one conversations to confirm that the form was easy to use. Any areas where the case managers had questions or trouble were good indicators that the digital form needed tweaking. Finally, they arrived at a version that was easy to use and improved the previous safety and efficiency concerns. 

**Why did the PRA not cover this research?** 

In this project, the ORR directly observed case workers (not federal employees) using a form via one-on-one interviews to understand any usability concerns. They asked non-standardized questions on a particular process, theme, or issue without any specification of the information being sought. [See 5 CFR 1320.3(h)(3).](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320){:target="blank"}

### Case study 7: Conducting user research with students and families

**Project** 

College Scorecard, Department of Education - August 2015

**Problem** 

Deciding on a college can be an overwhelming task with limited access to reliable information on student outcomes like student earnings, graduates’ student debt, and borrowers’ repayment rates. 

**Solution** 

In September 2015, the Department of Education launched the College Scorecard, which made data transparent for the public about colleges by leveraging existing data on costs, graduation, etc. and providing new data points on earnings after attendance, student debt, and borrower repayment rates. As these data sets were published through an open application programming interface (API), researchers, policymakers, and the public could customize their analysis of college performance easily. For more information on this project, check out [the Obama White House blog post](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/09/12/under-hood-building-new-college-scorecard-students){:target="blank"}, "Under the Hood: Building a College Scorecard with Students."

**User research** 

The team conducted user research at every single step in the project. This user research involved one-on-one conversations with high school students in Washington, D.C.’s Anacostia neighborhood, guidance counselors, 4-H kids, parents, college advisors, and data journalists. They also conducted research and met one-on-one with a diverse set of stakeholders across the higher education community to learn about their concerns, ideas, and hopes for how they could help students and families make a more informed decision. 

Based on this research, the team developed a College Scorecard prototype and then turned it into a website. The prototype was put in front of students during one-on-one sessions, to observe if the tool was easy to use. The research revealed that students were unlikely to use a mobile app and were hesitant to use government websites, so the team ensured other sites that were actually frequented by students had access to the same data. 

**Why did the PRA not cover this research**? 

In this project, the Department of Education directly observed the program applicants and participants engaging with the College Scorecard.  The Department of Education also asked non-standardized questions on a particular process, theme, or issue without any specification of the information being sought. See [5 CFR 1320.3(h)(3).](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320){:target="blank"}

## Ready to conduct user research?

Throughout this piece, we emphasized the significance of user research and described some ways to incorporate it into agency projects without conducting a PRA information collection. These examples showcase how an agency can successfully conduct user research to improve delivery of services. 

Agencies should incorporate user research into their work to make well-informed decisions, minimize risk, and save time and money. These case studies are a reminder that by applying user research best practices, agencies can build trust in government and improve customer experience for all Americans.
