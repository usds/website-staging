    **Hiring process**

    1. Complete the application below and attach your resume (and portfolio, if you're a designer!).
    2. People who progress to the interview process will connect with a member of our talent team over the phone.
    3. Participate in interviews to assess for skills important to our communities of practice.
    4. If selected, your talent partner will work with you to match you to a project.

    Onboarding to USDS can take several weeks, and sometimes longer depending on completion of a required background check. Our talent team will be with you every step of the way, and your talent partner will keep you up-to-date throughout the process.

    If you aren't selected to join USDS, you can apply again after one year with an updated resume.
