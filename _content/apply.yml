    We're working to build a workforce that reflects the people we serve. We know that we better serve the public when our staff represents the country's diversity.

    Our projects impact people who come from diverse backgrounds, speak multiple languages, hold varying levels of education, and have differing access to technology. We want to build project teams that can understand a variety of lived experiences as we work to deliver services to all people, including those who have traditionally been underserved.

    USDS operates on a tour-of-service model where people can join for up to four years. We're always looking for mission-driven people to serve. To learn more about the skills we're hiring for, see ["How we work."](https://www.usds.gov/how-we-work)
